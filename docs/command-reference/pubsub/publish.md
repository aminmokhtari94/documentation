# PUBLISH

<PageTitle title="Redis PUBLISH Explained (Better Than Official Docs)" />

## Introduction and Use Case(s)

The `PUBLISH` command in Redis is used to send a message to a specified channel. This command is part of the publish/subscribe (pub/sub) messaging paradigm, which enables message broadcasting to multiple subscribers. Typical use cases include real-time notifications, chat applications, and live updates where multiple clients need to receive the same information simultaneously.

## Syntax

```plaintext
PUBLISH <channel> <message>
```

## Parameter Explanations

- **channel**: The name of the channel to which the message will be published. Expected to be a string.
- **message**: The content of the message that will be sent to all subscribers of the specified channel. Expected to be a string.

## Return Values

The `PUBLISH` command returns an integer representing the number of clients that received the message.

Example:

```plaintext
(integer) 3
```

This means three clients subscribed to the specified channel received the message.

## Code Examples

```cli
dragonfly> SUBSCRIBE mychannel
Reading messages... (press Ctrl-C to quit)
1) "subscribe"
2) "mychannel"
3) (integer) 1

# In another CLI session
dragonfly> PUBLISH mychannel "Hello, World!"
(integer) 1

# Subscriber output
1) "message"
2) "mychannel"
3) "Hello, World!"
```

## Best Practices

- Use meaningful channel names to avoid conflicts and confusion.
- Ensure the message size and frequency are within acceptable limits to prevent performance degradation.

## Common Mistakes

### Publishing to Non-Existent Channels

Publishing to a channel with no subscribers will return 0. It is not an error but indicates no clients received the message.

### Incorrect Data Types

Ensure the message and channel parameters are strings to avoid unexpected behavior.

## FAQs

### What happens if I publish to a channel with no subscribers?

A: The `PUBLISH` command will return 0, indicating no clients received the message.

### Can I publish binary data?

A: No, the `PUBLISH` command expects the message to be a string.
