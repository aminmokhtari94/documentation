# QUIT

<PageTitle title="Redis QUIT Explained (Better Than Official Docs)" />

## Introduction and Use Case(s)

The `QUIT` command in Redis is used to close the connection between the client and the server. This command is typically used at the end of a series of operations when the client no longer needs to communicate with the Redis server.

## Syntax

```plaintext
QUIT
```

## Parameter Explanations

The `QUIT` command does not take any parameters. It is simply issued alone to close the current connection.

## Return Values

The `QUIT` command always returns `OK`.

### Example:

```cli
dragonfly> QUIT
OK
```

## Code Examples

```cli
dragonfly> SET mykey "value"
OK
dragonfly> GET mykey
"value"
dragonfly> QUIT
OK
```

## Best Practices

- Use `QUIT` to gracefully terminate the connection, especially in environments where resources are limited, ensuring that connections do not linger unnecessarily.
- Incorporate `QUIT` in scripts or automated tasks after all necessary Redis commands have been executed to maintain good resource management.

## Common Mistakes

- Issuing `QUIT` prematurely before completing all intended operations can lead to an incomplete execution of tasks.
- Not using `QUIT` in long-lived applications can result in unnecessary consumption of resources on the Redis server due to idle connections.

## FAQs

### When should I use the QUIT command?

Use `QUIT` at the end of your session with the Redis server when you no longer need to maintain an open connection.

### What happens if I donâ€™t use QUIT?

If `QUIT` is not used, the connection remains open until it times out or is explicitly closed by the client application. This can lead to resource wastage on the server.

### Does issuing QUIT save data automatically?

No, `QUIT` merely closes the connection. Any data persistence must be handled through appropriate Redis commands like `SAVE` or `BGSAVE` before calling `QUIT`.
