# CLIENT SETNAME

<PageTitle title="Redis CLIENT SETNAME Explained (Better Than Official Docs)" />

## Introduction and Use Case(s)

The `CLIENT SETNAME` command in Redis assigns a name to the current connection, making it easier to identify connections when using commands like `CLIENT LIST`. This is particularly useful in environments where multiple clients connect to the same Redis server, as it allows for better monitoring and debugging.

## Syntax

```cli
CLIENT SETNAME connection-name
```

## Parameter Explanations

- `connection-name`: A string that represents the name you want to assign to the current client connection. This name will appear in the output of `CLIENT LIST`.

## Return Values

- **Simple String Reply**: Returns "OK" if the operation was successful.

Example:

```cli
dragonfly> CLIENT SETNAME myclient
"OK"
```

## Code Examples

```cli
dragonfly> CLIENT SETNAME myclient
"OK"
dragonfly> CLIENT LIST
"id=3 addr=127.0.0.1:6379 fd=7 name=myclient age=10 idle=0 flags=N db=0 sub=0 psub=0 multi=-1 qbuf=0 qbuf-free=32768 obl=0 oll=0 omem=0 events=r cmd=client"
```

## Best Practices

- Use meaningful names for client connections to easily trace back issues or monitor specific client behaviors.
- Regularly update or manage client names if your application logic involves dynamic or frequently changing client states.

## Common Mistakes

- Not setting a name for client connections, leading to difficulty in identifying and managing them during troubleshooting.
- Using non-descriptive or generic names that do not provide insight into the client's role or purpose.

## FAQs

### What happens if I don't set a name for a client connection?

If you don't set a name, the connection will appear without a name in the `CLIENT LIST`, making it harder to identify and manage.

### Can I change the name of an existing client connection?

Yes, you can simply reissue the `CLIENT SETNAME` command with a new name for the same connection. The new name will overwrite the old one.
