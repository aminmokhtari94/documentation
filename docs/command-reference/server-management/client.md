# CLIENT

<PageTitle title="Redis CLIENT Explained (Better Than Official Docs)" />

## Introduction and Use Case(s)

The `CLIENT` command in Redis is used to manage client connections, retrieve information about clients, and control client state. It's especially useful for monitoring, debugging, and optimizing the performance of your Redis instance. Typical scenarios include tracking client connections, terminating connections, and setting specific client attributes.

## Syntax

```cli
CLIENT <subcommand> [arguments]
```

## Parameter Explanations

- **subcommand**: The specific operation to perform. Common subcommands include:

  - **LIST**: Lists all connected clients.
  - **KILL**: Terminates a client connection.
  - **GETNAME**: Retrieves the name of the current connection (set by `CLIENT SETNAME`).
  - **SETNAME**: Assigns a name to the current connection.
  - **PAUSE**: Suspends all client connections for a specified number of milliseconds.

- **arguments**: Additional parameters required by some subcommands.

## Return Values

- **LIST**: Returns a bulk string with details about each connected client.
- **KILL**: Returns `OK` if the client was successfully terminated.
- **GETNAME**: Returns the connection name as a simple string, or an empty bulk string if no name is set.
- **SETNAME**: Always returns `OK`.
- **PAUSE**: Returns `OK`.

## Code Examples

### List Connected Clients

```cli
dragonfly> CLIENT LIST
"id=2 addr=127.0.0.1:6379 fd=5 name= age=15 idle=0 flags=N db=0 sub=0 psub=0 multi=-1 qbuf=0 qbuf-free=32768 obl=0 oll=0 omem=0 events=r cmd=client"
```

### Set and Get Client Name

```cli
dragonfly> CLIENT SETNAME myclient
OK
dragonfly> CLIENT GETNAME
"myclient"
```

### Kill a Client Connection

```cli
dragonfly> CLIENT KILL id 2
OK
```

### Pause Client Connections

```cli
dragonfly> CLIENT PAUSE 5000
OK
```

## Best Practices

- Use `CLIENT LIST` to monitor connected clients and detect potential issues such as long-running or blocked clients.
- Assign meaningful names to client connections with `CLIENT SETNAME` to make monitoring easier.
- Be cautious when using `CLIENT KILL`, as it will forcefully terminate connections.

## Common Mistakes

- Not specifying the correct subcommand can lead to errors.
- Using `CLIENT KILL` without proper filtering can terminate unintended connections.

## FAQs

### What happens if I use `CLIENT PAUSE`?

`CLIENT PAUSE` blocks all clients from executing commands for the specified duration. This can be useful for maintenance operations that require a momentary pause in client activity.

### Can `CLIENT SETNAME` be used for any purpose?

Yes, setting a client name helps in identifying and managing connections more easily, especially in environments with many clients.
