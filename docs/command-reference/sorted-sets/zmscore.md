# ZMSCORE

<PageTitle title="Redis ZMSCORE Explained (Better Than Official Docs)" />

## Introduction and Use Case(s)

`ZMSCORE` is a Redis command used to get the scores associated with the specified members in the sorted set stored at a given key. This is useful when you need to retrieve multiple scores in one operation, minimizing network overhead and improving performance.

Typical scenarios include scoring systems, leaderboards, or any application that tracks and ranks items by score.

## Syntax

```cli
ZMSCORE key member [member ...]
```

## Parameter Explanations

- **key**: The name of the sorted set.
- **member**: One or more members for which you want to retrieve the scores.

## Return Values

The command returns an array of scores for the specified members, where each element corresponds to the score of the respective member. If a member does not exist in the sorted set, the corresponding element will be `nil`.

Examples:

- If all members are found: `[score1, score2, ...]`
- If some members are missing: `[score1, nil, score3, ...]`

## Code Examples

```cli
dragonfly> ZADD myzset 1 "one" 2 "two" 3 "three"
(integer) 3
dragonfly> ZMSCORE myzset "one" "two" "four"
1) "1"
2) "2"
3) (nil)
```

## Best Practices

- Use `ZMSCORE` instead of multiple `ZSCORE` commands to reduce the number of round-trip times between your application and the Redis server.

## Common Mistakes

- **Using incorrect types**: Ensure the key refers to a sorted set. Using `ZMSCORE` on a key of a different type will result in an error.
- **Misspelling member names**: Incorrectly spelled member names will return `nil`, which can be mistaken for the member not existing in the set.

## FAQs

### What happens if some of the specified members do not exist?

The command will return `nil` for those members, indicating they are not present in the sorted set.

### Can I use `ZMSCORE` with other data types?

No, the `ZMSCORE` command is specifically designed for sorted sets. Using it with other data types will result in an error.
