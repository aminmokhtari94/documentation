# LLEN

<PageTitle title="Redis LLEN Explained (Better Than Official Docs)" />

## Introduction and Use Case(s)

The `LLEN` command in Redis is used to get the length of a list stored at a specified key. This command is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to monitor the size of a list for purposes such as rate limiting, queue length monitoring, or validating that operations are performed correctly on lists.

## Syntax

```plaintext
LLEN key
```

## Parameter Explanations

- **key**: The name of the list whose length you want to retrieve. It must be an existing Redis list key.

## Return Values

The length of the list at the specified key. If the key does not exist, it returns 0 because an absent list is considered to have zero elements.

### Examples:

- For a non-empty list: `(integer) 3`
- For an empty list: `(integer) 0`
- For a non-existent key: `(integer) 0`
- For a key that holds a different type (like a string or set): Error message indicating wrong data type.

## Code Examples

```cli
dragonfly> RPUSH mylist "first"
(integer) 1
dragonfly> RPUSH mylist "second"
(integer) 2
dragonfly> RPUSH mylist "third"
(integer) 3
dragonfly> LLEN mylist
(integer) 3
dragonfly> DEL mylist
(integer) 1
dragonfly> LLEN mylist
(integer) 0
dragonfly> SET mystring "value"
OK
dragonfly> LLEN mystring
(error) WRONGTYPE Operation against a key holding the wrong kind of value
```

## Best Practices

- Always ensure the key you're using with `LLEN` refers to a list to avoid type errors.
- Monitor your list lengths regularly if you're using lists to handle tasks like job queues to prevent overflows and performance issues.

## Common Mistakes

- Using `LLEN` on keys that do not hold lists can lead to errors. Make sure to check the type of the key before performing operations.

## FAQs

### What happens if I use LLEN on a key that doesn't exist?

`LLEN` will return 0 if the specified key does not exist in the database.

### Can LLEN be used with other data types?

No, `LLEN` is specifically designed for lists. Using it with other data types will result in a WRONGTYPE error.
