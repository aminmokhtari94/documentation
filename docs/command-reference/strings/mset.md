# MSET

<PageTitle title="Redis MSET Explained (Better Than Official Docs)" />

## Introduction

The `MSET` command in Redis allows you to set multiple key-value pairs at once. It's an atomic operation, meaning either all keys are set, or none are if there's an error. This command is particularly useful for batch processing and reducing round-trip time between client and server.

## Syntax

```plaintext
MSET key1 value1 [key2 value2 ...]
```

## Parameter Explanations

- `key1 value1`: The first key and its corresponding value.
- `[key2 value2 ...]`: Additional keys and values can be specified in subsequent pairs. Each key must have a value.

## Return Values

- `OK`: Always returns "OK" as long as the command is properly executed.

## Code Examples

### Basic Example

Set multiple key-value pairs using `MSET`:

```cli
dragonfly> MSET key1 "value1" key2 "value2" key3 "value3"
OK
dragonfly> GET key1
"value1"
dragonfly> GET key2
"value2"
dragonfly> GET key3
"value3"
```

### Caching User Profiles

Use `MSET` to cache multiple user profiles in one command:

```cli
dragonfly> MSET user:1000:name "Alice" user:1000:age "30" user:1001:name "Bob" user:1001:age "24"
OK
dragonfly> GET user:1000:name
"Alice"
dragonfly> GET user:1001:age
"24"
```

### Configuration Settings

Batch update configuration settings stored in Redis:

```cli
dragonfly> MSET site_name "ExampleSite" admin_email "admin@example.com" max_users "1000"
OK
dragonfly> GET site_name
"ExampleSite"
dragonfly> GET admin_email
"admin@example.com"
```

## Best Practices

- Ensure that the number of key-value pairs is manageable within your application's context to avoid overwhelming the Redis server.
- Use `MSET` to optimize performance when setting multiple related keys simultaneously instead of multiple `SET` commands.

## Common Mistakes

- Forgetting that `MSET` does not support setting expiry times for keys. To set expiry times, use `PEXPIRE` or similar commands after `MSET`.
- Attempting to use `MSET` with non-string values without proper serialization, which might lead to unexpected results.

## FAQs

### What happens if one of the keys already exists?

`MSET` will overwrite any existing keys without warning.

### Can I use `MSET` to set keys with different data types?

No, `MSET` sets keys to string values. For other data types, consider serializing the data before using `MSET`.

### How do I handle large batches of key-value pairs?

For very large numbers of keys and values, ensure your Redis server has sufficient memory and monitor performance. Consider breaking down large batches into smaller ones if necessary.
