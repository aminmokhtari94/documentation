# MGET

<PageTitle title="Redis MGET Explained (Better Than Official Docs)" />

## Introduction

The `MGET` command in Redis is used to retrieve the values of multiple keys in a single call. This is efficient for fetching data as it minimizes the number of round trips between the client and server. Itâ€™s essential when dealing with scenarios where you require the values of several keys simultaneously, such as caching or bulk reads.

## Syntax

```plaintext
MGET key [key ...]
```

## Parameter Explanations

- `key`: The key for which the value needs to be retrieved. Multiple keys can be specified, separated by spaces.

## Return Values

The command returns an array of values corresponding to the specified keys.

#### Example Outputs

- If all keys exist: An array of values.
- If some keys do not exist: An array containing `nil` at the positions of the nonexistent keys.

## Code Examples

### Basic Example

Fetching values of multiple keys:

```cli
dragonfly> SET key1 "value1"
OK
dragonfly> SET key2 "value2"
OK
dragonfly> MGET key1 key2 key3
1) "value1"
2) "value2"
3) (nil)
```

### Caching User Profiles

Retrieve user profile data stored in multiple keys:

```cli
dragonfly> MGET user:1000:name user:1000:email user:1000:age
1) "Alice"
2) "alice@example.com"
3) "30"
```

### Fetching Configuration Settings

Retrieve application configuration settings stored in separate keys:

```cli
dragonfly> MGET config:timeout config:max_connections config:debug_mode
1) "300"
2) "100"
3) "true"
```

### Task Management

Retrieve status information for multiple tasks:

```cli
dragonfly> MGET task:1:status task:2:status task:3:status
1) "completed"
2) "in-progress"
3) (nil)
```

## Best Practices

- Use `MGET` to reduce the number of round trips to the Redis server when you need multiple values.
- Ensure that the keys requested in `MGET` are related and often needed together to maximize efficiency.

## Common Mistakes

- Requesting a large number of keys without considering the network overhead and latency.
- Assuming that all keys will exist; always handle `nil` values in your application logic.

## FAQs

### What happens if a key does not exist?

If a key does not exist, `MGET` returns `nil` for that particular key.

### Is `MGET` atomic?

No, `MGET` itself is not atomic. However, Redis guarantees that the command will fetch all specified keys consistently within the same logical operation.
