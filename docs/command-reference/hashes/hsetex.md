# HSETEX

<PageTitle title="Redis HSETEX Explained (Better Than Official Docs)" />

## Introduction and Use Case(s)

`HSETEX` is a hypothetical command that combines the functionality of `HSET` and `EXPIRE`. It sets a field in the hash stored at a key, along with an expiration time for the entire hash. This command can be particularly useful when you need to ensure that hash entries automatically expire after a certain period.

Typical scenarios include caching user sessions, temporary data storage, and rate-limiting information where both the data needs to be set and its lifetime managed simultaneously.

## Syntax

```plaintext
HSETEX key field value seconds
```

## Parameter Explanations

- **key**: The name of the key holding the hash.
- **field**: The field within the hash to set.
- **value**: The value to associate with the field.
- **seconds**: The expiration time in seconds for the hash.

## Return Values

The return type for `HSETEX` would typically be an integer indicating if a new field was added or if an existing field was updated:

- `(integer) 1`: If a new field is created.
- `(integer) 0`: If the field already existed and was updated.

## Code Examples

```cli
dragonfly> HSETEX myhash field1 "value1" 60
(integer) 1
dragonfly> HSETEX myhash field2 "value2" 120
(integer) 1
dragonfly> HEXISTS myhash field1
(integer) 1
dragonfly> TTL myhash
(integer) 60
dragonfly> HSETEX myhash field1 "newvalue" 180
(integer) 0
dragonfly> TTL myhash
(integer) 180
```

## Best Practices

- Use `HSETEX` for cache-related hashes where you want automatic cleanup without needing separate commands for setting expiration.

## Common Mistakes

- Setting different expirations for fields within the same hash won't work as expected because the TTL applies to the entire hash, not individual fields.
- Overwriting fields without considering the hash's current TTL might lead to unexpected expiration behaviors.

## FAQs

### What happens to the TTL if I use HSETEX on an existing hash?

Using `HSETEX` on an existing hash with a new TTL will reset the TTL to the specified duration. This can affect all entries in the hash.

### Can I use HSETEX to set multiple fields at once?

No, `HSETEX` operates on a single field at a time. To set multiple fields, you would need to call `HSETEX` multiple times or use a combination of `HMSET` and `EXPIRE`.
