# HMGET

<PageTitle title="Redis HMGET Explained (Better Than Official Docs)" />

## Introduction and Use Case(s)

The `HMGET` command in Redis is used to retrieve the values of specified fields from a hash stored at a key. It is particularly useful when you need to efficiently get multiple fields from a hash without having to fetch all the fields.

Typical scenarios include getting user profile information, configurations, or any other structured data that is stored as a hash.

## Syntax

```
HMGET key field1 [field2 ... fieldN]
```

## Parameter Explanations

- **key**: The name of the hash key.
- **field1 [field2 ... fieldN]**: One or more fields whose values are to be retrieved.

## Return Values

`HMGET` returns an array of values corresponding to the specified fields. If a field does not exist, the value for that field will be `nil`.

Examples:

- If all specified fields exist, it returns their values.
- If some fields do not exist, it returns `nil` for those fields.

## Code Examples

```cli
dragonfly> HSET myhash field1 "value1" field2 "value2"
(integer) 2
dragonfly> HMGET myhash field1 field2 field3
1) "value1"
2) "value2"
3) (nil)
```

## Best Practices

- Ensure the hash key exists before calling `HMGET` to avoid unnecessary nil values.
- Group related fields together in a single hash to minimize the number of `HMGET` calls needed.

## Common Mistakes

- Fetching a large number of fields that do not exist can lead to multiple `nil` values, which might need additional handling in your application logic.

## FAQs

### What happens if the hash key does not exist?

If the hash key does not exist, `HMGET` will return an array of `nil` values corresponding to each requested field.

### Can I use `HMGET` to fetch all fields in a hash?

No, `HMGET` requires you to specify which fields you want to retrieve. To get all fields and their values, use the `HGETALL` command instead.
