# HDEL

<PageTitle title="Redis HDEL Explained (Better Than Official Docs)" />

## Introduction and Use Case(s)

`HDEL` is a command used to delete one or more fields from a hash stored at a specified key. It is commonly used in scenarios where you need to remove specific elements from a hash, for instance, when managing user session data or updating configurations that don't require certain parameters anymore.

## Syntax

```cli
HDEL key field [field ...]
```

## Parameter Explanations

- **key**: The name of the hash from which the fields are to be removed.
- **field [field ...]**: One or more fields to be deleted from the hash. Multiple fields can be specified, separated by spaces.

## Return Values

- **(integer)**: The number of fields that were removed from the hash, not including specified but non-existent fields.

## Code Examples

```cli
dragonfly> HSET myhash field1 "value1" field2 "value2" field3 "value3"
(integer) 3
dragonfly> HDEL myhash field1
(integer) 1
dragonfly> HDEL myhash field2 field4
(integer) 1
dragonfly> HGETALL myhash
1) "field3"
2) "value3"
```

## Best Practices

- Ensure that the hash key exists before attempting to delete fields to avoid unnecessary operations.
- When deleting multiple fields, group them in a single `HDEL` command to reduce the number of operations and improve performance.

## Common Mistakes

- Trying to delete a field from a non-hash key will result in an error. Always verify that the target key is indeed a hash.
- Deleting non-existent fields does not produce an error but returns zero as the count of deleted fields.

## FAQs

### What happens if I try to delete a field that doesn't exist?

The command will simply return `(integer) 0`, indicating that no fields were removed since the specified field did not exist.
